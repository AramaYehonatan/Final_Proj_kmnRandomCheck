README for Final Project Report
Project Title: Coding Schemes for Constrained Systems

Project Number: P-2024-002
Department: Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University
Supervisors: Ohad Elishco
Students: Yehonatan Arama, Yuval Yacov Said

Project Overview
This project aims to develop an innovative encoding algorithm that addresses the KM repeat-free problem, a challenge in constrained coding systems where no local repetitions are allowed. The encoding scheme developed has applications in fields like data compression, error correction, and DNA storage systems.

Contents
Project Background
The project focuses on encoding for systems with constraints that eliminate local repetitions to ensure data integrity during decoding.

Objective
To create an efficient and decodable algorithm for generating repeat-free codes that addresses the KM repeat-free problem.

Innovation
The first of its kind, this project introduces a unique two-phase algorithm that compresses and then expands sequences while ensuring no repetitions.

Deliverables

Computer programs for encoding and decoding sequences.
An academic document detailing formal notations, algorithm descriptions, and proofs.
Simulation results validating the algorithmâ€™s efficiency.
Challenges and Solutions
The project tackled several challenges, including long simulation times and memory limitations, which were addressed through advanced algorithm design.

Conclusion
The project successfully developed an encoding algorithm with minimal redundancy. However, further work is needed to address specific issues in the expansion phase of the algorithm.
